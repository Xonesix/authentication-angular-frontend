## What is this?

This is an authentication implementation I did.
This is in conjunction with the ExpressJS back-end in repository
authentication-express-backend.

Supports cookie authentication with session setters
Hashing and Salting of passwords in the express backend
This is just a basic ui for these requests and maybe a template for future projects

**so i don't have to deal with more authentication than I want to**
